Maya Rose Photography is distinctive and unique, far from the mundane and ordinary.

Maya grew up in Crested Butte, a small, remote Colorado mountain town.  At a young age, she fell in love with the beauty of nature and remains enraptured by the audacity of the mountains.

As a child, she cultivated an imaginative spirit, participating in many art classes and nurturing a passion for art. Through study and practice, she molded her talent to capture reality through photography. Following graduation from high school, she moved to Miami where she now resides. Maya is currently enrolled in the Miami International University Of Art & Design majoring in photography. Today her work embraces both the climate and the culture of southern Florida.

Maya pursues her own style of photography, maintaining a high standard in the industry. She exudes a tremendous adoration for the beauty of nature and often incorporates that love in her approach and design, varying from bright colors in 'Miami Nights', floral designs in 'Mother Earth', to a mixture of beauty, style, and fashion in her portraits. Maya also deploys a chic natural feel in her model photography to emphasize key characteristics from her subjects.

Maya is a talented young photographer who loves to explore varieties of cinematography in her line of work. She will endorse any kind of challenge in photography brought to her and encourages that you will be interested in helping her experience and love for photography grow. She is excited to welcome you into her distinctive kind of photography and looks forward to you contacting her for your first photoshoot.
